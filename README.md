## Overview

🎲 **PaintScene4D** generates photorealistic 4D scenes from text prompts which are both spatially and temporally consistent. 

🚀 **PaintScene4D** generates 4D scenes in around 3hrs compared to SDS-based object level rendering methods that take around 12hrs to train and render. 

🛠️ **PaintScene4D** unlocks new capabilities for camera trajectory control, an edge over traditional text-to-video model which don't have any spatial understanding.
